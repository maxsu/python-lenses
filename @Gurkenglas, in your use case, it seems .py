@Gurkenglas, in your use case, it seems like you're trying improve system security, by eliminating risky attributes from an open AI pydantic model. You're also trying to reduce the complexity of the call stack, and improve the debugging story. I'll try to address these concerns in my response.

Firstly, I'll address the security concern. You're trying to sanitize a pydantic model, by removing blacklisted keys. You're also trying to raise an assertion error if the model contains unexpected values. This is a good practice, as it helps to reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information. However, I would suggest using a more generic approach to sanitizing the model, rather than hardcoding the blacklist. This would make the code more flexible and easier to maintain. This way, you can get the blacklist from a configuration file or an external source, making it easier to update and manage:

```py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from lenses import bind

import openai


blacklist = {
    "api_base_override": "None",
    "api_key": "sk-\w{48}",
    "api_type": "None",
    "api_version": "None",
    "openai_id": "chatcmpl-\w{29}",
    "organization": "user-\w{24}",
    "typed_api_type": ".*",
    "id": "chatcmpl-\w{29}",
    "object": "chat_completion",
    "created": "\d*",
    "model": "gpt-4-0314",
}


def sanitize_model_dict(model_dict: dict) -> dict:
    """Remove blacklisted keys, and raise AssertionError on unexpected values"""
    for attr, regex in blacklist.items():
        assert re.search(regex, str(model_dict.get(attr, None)))
        model_dict.pop(attr, None)
    return model_dict

def deep_sanitize_model_dict(model: BaseModel) -> dict:
    """Recursively sanitize a pydantic model"""
    model_dict = model.model_dump()
    view = bind(model_dict).Recur(dict)
    return view.modify(sanitize_model_dict)
```

I assume:
1. We are sanitizing pydantic models given by openai, which use the BaseModel class and use a method model_dump to get the model as a dictionary
2. We work over a dict-of-dicts, because doing  `Recur` on a pydantic model has  edge cases.
3. The assertion is designed to block the operation and flag a misconfiguration if our secret data shifts outside our expectations

For an example of an edge case, `Recur(BaseModel)` will fail to sanitize embedded dictionaries. This is because the `Recur` method cannot visit multiple types. As a future improvement, we could implement a `Recur` method that can visit multiple types, eg `Recur(BaseModel, dict)`. This would allow us to sanitize embedded dictionaries as well, making the code more robust. However, lets assume that we are projecting to a a dict-of-dicts for now.

As for further reducing the complexity of the call stack, still without addressing lenses, we can step back to optics.


## 1. Unroll `BaseUiLen.Recur` and `BoundLens.modify` to reduce the call stack

We can unroll the `Recur` and `modify` methods to reduce the call stack. This way, we can avoid using the `ui` library, and actually make the code easier to understand with optics:

```py
# We will replace:

#  lenses.ui.base::BaseUiLens
    def Recur(self, cls):
        return self._compose_optic(optics.RecurTraversal(cls))

# lenses.ui.__init__::BoundLens:
    def modify(self, func: Callable[[A], B]) -> T:
        return self._optic.over(self._state, func)

# With:

# lenses.optics.traversals::RecurTraversal
    def RecurTraversal(cls):
        return RecurTraversal(cls)
```

So with very little loss of convenience we can write:


```py
def deep_sanitize_model_dict(model: BaseModel) -> dict:
    model_dict = model.model_dump()
    optic = RecurTraversal(dict)
    return optic.over(model_dict, sanitize_model_dict)
```


Now if we look into the over method, things get a bit mystical!

```py
# lenses.optics.base::LensLike
    def over(self, state: S, fn: Callable[[A], B]) -> T:
        if not self._is_kind(Setter):
            raise TypeError("Must be an instance of Setter to .over()")

        def pure(a):
            return Identity(a)

        def func(a):
            return Identity(fn(a))

        return self.apply(func, pure, state).unwrap()
```

1. Pure lifts values to the identity monad
2  Func is a function that wraps the images of fn in the identity monad

In fact we have

```py
# lenses.identity::Identity
    @classmethod
    def pure(cls, item: A) -> "Identity[A]":
        return cls(item)

    def map(self, fn: Callable[[A], B]) -> "Identity[B]":
        return Identity(fn(self.item))

We can write:

```py
    def over(self, state: S, fn: Callable[[A], B]) -> T:
        if not self._is_kind(Setter):
            raise TypeError("Must be an instance of Setter to .over()")

        def pure_func(a):
            Identity(fn(a))

        return self.apply(pure_func, Identity.pure, state).unwrap()
```

The apply method invokes the func method on the functorized functors, with the state, and then unwraps the result. So we can write:


```py
# lenses.optics.base::LensLike
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def func(self, f, state):
        message = "Tried to use unimplemented lens {}."
        raise NotImplementedError(message.format(type(self)))

    def apply(self, f, pure, state):
        return self.func(Functorisor(pure, f), state)
```

First we take pure and pure_func and turn them into a functor, like so:

```py
# lenses.functorisor
class Functorisor(object):
    __slots__ = ("pure", "func")

    def __init__(self, pure_func, func):
        self.pure = pure_func
        self.func = func

    def __call__(self, arg):
        return self.func(arg)

    def map(self, f):
        def new_f(a):
            return fmap(self.func(a), f)

        return Functorisor(self.pure, new_f)

    def update(self, fn):
        return Functorisor(self.pure, lambda state: fn(self, state))

````


The func implementation for RecurTraversal is inherited from Traversal:

```py
# lenses.optics.traversal::Traversal
    def func(self, f: Functorisor, state):
        foci = list(self.folder(state))
        if foci == []:
            return f.pure(state)
        collector = collect_args(len(foci))
        applied = multiap(collector, *map(f, foci))
        apbuilder = functools.partial(self.builder, state)
        return typeclass.fmap(applied, apbuilder)
```


1. If there are no foci, we return the pure lifted state
2. We collect the arguments for the foci
3. We apply the functoriser to the foci
4. This applies the f lifted function to each focus
